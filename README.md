# Random_Forest_Heat_Transfer
Random Forest algorithm is used to predict convective heat loss from Concentrated Solar Power Receiver. For upward facing high temperature range cavity receiver, this model can be used.
This model is published as Thesis paper at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, 2021.
